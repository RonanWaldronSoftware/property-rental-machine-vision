# property-rental-machine-vision
intelliRent is a rental platform including a comprehensive suite of tools currently in development, designed to manage property rental and to assist renters in identifying potential sources of damage from images before having to step foot on the property.

Images of an advertised property are screened by a highly intelligent, purpose built machine vision model designed to give early warning to prospective renters on whether signs of mould or water damage are present or potentially present.
